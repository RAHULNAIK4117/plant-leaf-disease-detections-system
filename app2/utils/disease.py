        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/>Gray leaf spot lesions on corn leaves hinder photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated towards grain fill. The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grainfill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress past the ear leaf around pollination time.	Because a decrease in functioning leaf area limits photosynthates dedicated towards grainfill, the plant might mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill kernels.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion.

        <br/><br/> 1. The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring.

        <br/> 2. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems. 

        <br/> 3. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.

        <br/>2. Keep the fruit planting and surrounding areas free of weeds and tall grass. This practice will promote lower relative humidity and rapid drying of vines and thereby limit fungal infection.
        
        <br/>3. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram.

        <br/><br/> 1. The fungus causes plants to lose their leaves; it is a major disease. If infection occurs before the fruit has developed, yields are low.

        <br/> 2. This is a common disease on tomato in Pacific island countries. The disease occurs in the screen house and in the field.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base

        <br/>2. Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
        
        <br/>3. Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
        <br/>4. Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.""",


    'Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Yellow Leaf Curl Virus<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1.The Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) is spread by the whitefly insect, known as Bemisia tabaci. The virus can be passed on when the whitefly is an adult.

        <br/> 2. The whitefly can pick up the virus in just 15-20 minutes and can pass it on after waiting 8-24 hours.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties.

        <br/>2. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission.
        
        <br/>3. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.""",




    'Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Mosaic Virus<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. Tomato mosaic virus can live for up to two years in dry soil or leaf debris, but only a month in moist soil. It can also survive in infected roots in the soil.

        <br/> 2. Seeds can carry the virus, but it mainly spreads through human activities. The virus can easily transfer between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes during tasks like tying plants, removing suckers, and harvesting.
        <br/> 3. The virus can survive the tobacco curing process and can spread from cigarettes or tobacco products to plants if workers handle them after smoking.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>


        <br/>1. Purchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.

        <br/>2. Inspect transplants prior to purchase. Choose only transplants showing no clear symptoms.
        
        <br/>3. Avoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.
        <br/>4. Wash hands with soap and water before and during the handling of plants to reduce potential spread between plants."""
